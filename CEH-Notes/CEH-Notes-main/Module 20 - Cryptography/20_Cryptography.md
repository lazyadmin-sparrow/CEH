## Terms  -> module 1 -> module 20
  - **Clear text / plaintext**: the unencrypted data
  - **Cipher text**: the encrypted data
  - **Key**: specifies the transformation of data for encryption / decryption ("key" is not synonymous with "password", although a password can in fact be used as a key)
- **Cipher**: an algorithm for performing encryption and decryption

# Symmetric cryptography
  - Use the same key for the encryption and the decryption
  - Symmetric-key either use stream cipher and block cipher
  - Popular algorithms: AES, DES

# Asymmetric / Public Key cryptography
  - Two key used: public and private
  - Public key is publicly known to everyone, issued by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and use to encrypt the data
  - Private key is a secret for the public,only known by the owner and it is used to decrypt the data
  - Asymmetric cryptography delivers confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation
  - Popular algorithms : RSA, DSA and Diffie-Hellman, ECDHA

# Substitution Cipher
  - Every character is substituted with another one
  - More on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher)
  - Example cipher : [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

Example:
```
Plaintext :  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Ciphertext : QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD

Key : right shift of 3
```

# Transposition Cipher
  - The positions held by units of plaintext are shifted according to a regular system
  - Example cipher [Rail Fence cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence)

Example:
```
Clear text: WE ARE DISCOVERED. FLEE AT ONCE

W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E           00..........00..........00
. E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C .           ...00....00....00....00...
. . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . .           ......00..........00......

Ciphertext: WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN

# Polyalphabetic Cipher
- Based on substitution
- Using multiple substitution alphabets
- Example cipher : [VigenÃ¨re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)

# Stream Cipher
- Text digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream)
- Each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the stream
- Example cipher: RC4, Salsalsa 20, Cacha20

# Block Cipher
  - Operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called a block, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key
  - Example cipher: AES, DES, 3DES, 2DES

# Symmetric Algorithms

# Data Encryption Standard (DES)
  - Introduced in 1975
  - Standardized in 1977 by NIST
  - Problem with DES: short key length (56 bits) -> ASICS Chips
  - Now considered as insecure
  - Improved version: Triple DES (involves DES three times)
  - Problem with Triple DES: slow, compute heavy

# Modes of Operations
  - Electronic Code Book (ECB)
  - Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
  - Output Feedback Mode (OFB)
  - Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)

# Hashing
  Generating a unique Alphanumeric String for a short of Characters, Program, Application, Files, etc.
  Avalanche Effect --> If you change a binary bit, Hash Value Will Change Drastically. This is Called Avalanche Effect.
